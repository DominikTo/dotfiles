# dotfiles

## Introduction

In an attempt to avoid later frustration, finally starting to preserve my machine configuration somewhere.
This is nowhere near being done and most probably broken.

**Don't use this. Seriously!** :)

## Inspiration

* [GitHub does dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io)

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:DominikTo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap
```

## Update

```sh
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap
```
